# Impact of Infectious Diseases on Flights

## Background and Motivation
The project was inspired by COVID-19â€™s massive recent impact on airline industry. We wondered have other disease outbreaks caused similar impacts on flying? Does the amount of an epidemic's cases or deaths influence the number of flights? Does the mortality rate play any significant role?

## Data Sources
1) Bureau of Transportation Statistics - https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Data_Elements.aspx?Data=2 - US flight data for domestic and international
2) Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) - https://data.humdata.org/dataset/ebola-cases-2014 - Ebola data
3) Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/sars-outbreak-2003-complete-dataset - SARS data
4) World Health Organization (WHO) - http://apps.who.int/flumart/Default?ReportNo=12 - H1N1 data
5) Kaggle -  https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp - MERS data

## Flight Data
The total US domestic and international flights overall behavior between 2003 and 2019 is shown in the below plot. Flight data trend is cyclical and seasonal.

## Overall Epidemic Comparison
We decided to consider four epidemics with the aim of having broader responses and higher certainty on our results. The chart of the four diseases is displayed as follows. H1N1 has the highest number of estimated cases with the lowest mortality rate. Ebola and MERS have the higher mortality rates with 39.52% and 34.38%, respectively.
